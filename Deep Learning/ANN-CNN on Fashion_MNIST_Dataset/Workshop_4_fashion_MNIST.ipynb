        "The Perceptron is designed to solve **binary classification problems**. By learning the best weights for a given problem, the Perceptron can be used to classify a set of inputs into one of two possible outputs. However, the Perceptron is very limited in scope because not only is it limited to solving binary classification problems, but it can only find the optimal weights for **linearly separable** binary classification problems. These are problems where a straight line or multi-dimensional hyperplane can simply separate the two classes.\n",

        "In a densely connected layer, each neuron from the group of neurons on the left is connected to every other neuron from the group of neurons on the right. In the example above, **hidden layer 1** is densely connected because every neuron from the **input layer** is connected to every neuron in **hidden layer 1**. Each connection between the layers has a numerical weight attached to it.\n",

        "After multiplying the weights from the input layer by the inputs and computing the sum in each output neuron we still have one more step left to do, and that is applying an activation function to the outputs. In the Perceptron example, we used a unit-step function as our activation function, but for deep neural networks, we can introduce another activation function, called the **sigmoid or logistic function**. The function is defined mathematically by the following equation:\n",

        "\n",
        "#### The Softmax Activation Function\n",
        "Another activation function, which we usually see at the final or output layer of neural networks is the **softmax activation function**. Unlike the sigmoid activation function, which takes a single value as input, the **softmax function** takes a **vector as input** and produces a **vector of the same shape as the output**. In a way, this function basically acts on an entire layer. The softmax function basically converts a vector of real values into a **probability distribution** and is useful for representing the probabilities of different classes. This function is defined mathematically below:\n",
        "\n",
        "Given a vector $z = (z_{1}, z_{2}, ..., z_{n})$, the result of applying softmax $\\sigma(z)$, is defined as:\n",
        "\n",
        "$$ \\sigma(z)_{i} = \\frac{e^{z_{i}}}{\\sum_{j=1}^n e^{z_{j}}}$$\n",
        "\n",
        "In **plain english**, what the equation above really means is that to get the softmax of a vector, **we raise $e$ to the power of each value in the vector and sum up the results**. Then for each value, **we raise $e$ to the power of that value and divide it by this sum**. This process guarantees that all of the values will **sum up to 1**. (Note that the natural constant $e$, is approximately equal to 2.71828)\n",
        "\n",
        "#### An Example with Real Numbers \n",
        "If we took the values from our output layer in the previous example before applying sigmoid and instead applied softmax, we would calculate the softmax as follows:\n",
        "\n",
        "Our input vector is $z = \\begin{bmatrix} 3 & 1.5 & 6 \\end{bmatrix}$. If we calculate the sum of raising $e$ to the power of each value, we get $e^3 + e^{1.5} + e^6 \\approx 427.996$. Now for each value we just raise $e$ to the power of that value and divide it by our previous sum. \n",
        "\n",
        "$$\\frac{e^{3}}{427.996} \\approx 0.04692926$$\n",
        "\n",
        "$$\\frac{e^{1.5}}{427.996} \\approx 0.01047133$$\n",

        "#### Why Softmax??\n",
        "Softmax is useful because it allows us to represent probabilities. In our problem, we have ten possible digits that an image can correspond to. Sometimes there is a little bit of uncertainty involved in the category that an image belongs to and even humans can see this when we can't tell if someone has drawn a one or a seven. For this problem, we want our neural network to produce not one but **ten outputs** with each output corresponding to the **probability** of an image corresponding to a specific digit. The following example image is not specific to the MNIST problem, but demonstrates the idea of using softmax for probabilities: \n",

        "## Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)\n",
        "Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are designed for image data and inspired by local regions of activity in the visual cortex. The main innovation in CNNs lies in their ability to effectively recognize patterns in spatial data. \n",
        "\n",
        "Recall that in the previous section we had to flatten the images and give our deep neural network 784 pixel vectors as input. However, CNNs can work with 2D input structures such as images using **convolutional layers**.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Convolutional Layers\n",
        "The **convolutional layer** is the fundamental unit of CNNs. This layer passes over local two-dimensional regions in the image and performs a **convolution** operation on each region. The **convolution** operation displayed below is similar to multiplying weights except it operates on matrices instead of vectors.\n",
        "\n",
        "![convolution operation](https://docs.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1POU_9SZQmCeYJLisYpr-qy55DTdw5lpm)\n",
        "\n",
        "(image source: http://www.davidsbatista.net/blog/2018/03/31/SentenceClassificationConvNets/)\n",
        "\n",
        "In the image above the convolution operation involves taking a **3 x 3 subsection of the input image** and multiplying it by a **3 x 3 kernel of weights** and summing the products to produce a single element in the output. This operation is kind of like a 2D dot product and is repeated by sliding the **kernel** or **convolution filter** with a fixed **stride** such as 1 pixel length, across the image until all input pixels have been covered. The GIF below demonstrates this concept:\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "A convolution filter basically looks for certain **features** in an image such as corners, curves, or circles. The **output** of sliding a convolution filter across an input image is a **feature map**, which is kind of like an image in terms of its dimensionality. A single convolution layer can have **multiple filters** that each look for different features. The size of the filter (in this case 3 x 3) is often referred to as the **kernel size**.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### ReLU Activation Function\n",
        "Convolutional layers typically use the **ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) activation function** which is really simple and represented by the following equation: $ R(z) = max(0, z) $. If we graph this function it looks like this:\n",
        "\n",

These large layers are good at learning patterns but can sometimes learn them too well, to the point where they memorize features unique to the training data and fail to generalize to the validation data. This is called **overfitting**. We can control overfitting by introducing **dropout** into these final layers. With **dropout**, during training we randomly remove the effect of certain neurons by **setting their activations to zero**. Note that this is just as good as removing these neurons temporarily. This prevents the network from relying too much on a few specific features and forces it to learn general patterns. We can specify the probability of dropping neurons in dropout layers in Keras.\n",
